# How we'll get it

Given sequencing data and TILs, we'll ask the teams to generate ranked lists of neoepitopes. If the pipeline includes multiple stages, we'll ask for a name for each stage and a ranked list of neoepitopes predicted at that stage.

We need to be clear about a few things:

## Tumor and Immune context
* Previous pathogen exposure of patient
* Microbiome of patient
* Capacity of patient to mount immune response
* Presence of licensing and co-stimulatory cells and cytokines

## Kinds of peptides
* Natural response, no treatment
* Response unleashed by checkpoint blockade (preferably PD-[L]1)
* Inclusion in vaccine

## Kinds of T cell response
* Should we phenotype the T cells to differentiate insufficiently activated T cells from activated and then suppressed T cells, e.g.
